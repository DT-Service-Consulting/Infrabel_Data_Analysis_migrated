Using predictive modeling, it was found that having ETCS has an **significant impact** on predicting delay times. This means that having ETCS helps us better anticipate delays, aiding train operators in improving schedules and punctuality.

ETCS significantly impacts delay predictions, explaining 27% of the variance in delays (R-squared = 0.58). This indicates that while other factors affect delays, ETCS plays a crucial role in enhancing predictive accuracy.

st.write("### Next Steps")
st.write("""
**Data Expansion**: Expand the dataset beyond a single day to cover a larger time frame (e.g., several months or years) to identify consistent patterns in train delays and incidents. This will improve the robustness of the insights.

**Explore Seasonal Variations**: Investigate seasonal effects on delays, especially during winter months, when non-ETCS lines experience significantly longer delays. This could help determine how much ETCS mitigates winter-related disruptions.

**Incident Analysis**: Perform a deeper analysis of the types of incidents causing delays (e.g., intrusions, technical failures) and evaluate the effectiveness of current mitigation strategies. Focus on Line 50A/3 and other lines with high incidents.

**Infrastructure Improvement**: Explore whether infrastructure improvements near border stations (e.g., upgrading to higher ETCS levels) could reduce delays, especially for stations with persistent high wait times.

**ETCS Optimization**: Study whether enhancing the ETCS system (e.g., upgrading from L2 FS to higher levels or implementing ETCS on non-ETCS lines) could lead to improved recovery times and reduced delays.

**Operational Adjustments**: Investigate the impact of scheduling adjustments for trains that are consistently late at departure. This could minimize cumulative delays and improve overall punctuality.

**Enhance Predictive Models**: Incorporate additional variables (e.g., weather conditions, maintenance schedules, crew shifts) to improve the accuracy of delay predictions, and develop a more comprehensive model for real-time applications. Due to lack of time only Random Forest regressor has been used, but a plethora of Machine Learning Models can be used for predictive Modelling.
         
**Identify Ripple Effect**: Separate primary and secondary delays in the dataset. This will allow for a better understanding of cascading delays. A solution can be developed to assign secondary delays to the appropriate causes, which can inform better operational decisions to minimize the ripple effect of delays.
  
**Dashboards**: Incorporating real-time data on train delays, incidents, and infrastructure conditions into the dashboard can greatly enhance decision-making. Dynamic dashboards that show live data on train movements, delays, and predicted disruptions will help railway operators manage delays more effectively.
 Develop a real-time dashboard to track delays, categorize them as primary or secondary, and predict the impact of current incidents. Real-time visualization can also inform infrastructure maintenance scheduling and provide immediate responses to reduce cascading delays.
         
**IT Maintaince**: Even though intrusions are the most common cause of delay, infrastructure-related issues (e.g., track problems, maintenance requirements) cause the most disruptive delays. These often result in severe network-wide delays.
Prioritize maintenance schedules for critical infrastructure that frequently causes delays. Analyzing data over time will allow you to predict when and where infrastructure maintenance is needed, helping to prevent future disruptions.
